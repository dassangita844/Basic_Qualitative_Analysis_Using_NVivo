# **Basic Qualitative Analysis Using NVivo**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on a basic qualitative analysis conducted using NVivo. A single conversation between an interviewer and a participant was analyzed to explore themes related to socioeconomic inequality, digital engagement, and its impact on college students. The analysis includes coding, chart generation, and visualization using NVivo tools.

## **Key Features**
- **Data Source**: A conversation retrieved via ChatGPT between an interviewer and a participant.
- **Qualitative Analysis**:  
  - Created codes to categorize key ideas and insights.  
  - Generated charts, diagrams, and a word cloud for data visualization.  
  - Downloaded and summarized the final NVivo report.

## **Steps Performed**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported the ChatGPT conversation into NVivo for analysis.
2. **Coding**:
   - Created and applied basic codes to categorize the data into themes.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Generated a word cloud, charts, and diagrams to highlight key insights.
4. **Report Generation**:
   - Compiled the analysis into a downloadable NVivo report.


## **How to Use**
1. **Download Files**: Access the conversation, codes, and NVivo outputs from the respective folders.
2. **Explore Visualizations**: Review the word cloud and charts to understand the insights.
3. **Analyze the Report**: Open the `report.docx` file for a detailed summary of the findings.


## **Technologies Used**
- **NVivo**: For qualitative data analysis and visualization.
- **ChatGPT**: For conversation collection.


## **Future Scope**
- Expand the dataset to include more participants.
- Perform deeper qualitative analysis with advanced NVivo features.
- Explore comparisons across different socioeconomic groups.
